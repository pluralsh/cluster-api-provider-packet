# PacketCluster CRD

The PacketCluster is the CRD that contains information about where to place the
Kubernetes cluster: facility and project.

We do not support cross facilities or multi projects cluster. If you need so my
suggestion is to look for what it is called [federation](k8s-federation).

## Topology

Each cluster we create leverages at least two Equinix Metal features: Device and ElasticIP.

Kubernetes node is a Device and each cluster has an
[ElasticIP](elastic-ip-packet) that is tagged with the name of the cluster.

The ElasticIP guarantees a stable endpoint even when the control plane(s) are
recycled during a Kubernetes version update or an outages.

## ElasticIP lifecycle

Every cluster has its own ElasticIP. It is tagged with the name of the cluster and
it does not get removed when a cluster is terminated. You have to remove it manually.

This is a safety feature in this way you can re-assign the IP to another
cluster with the same name.

## FAQ

**Does cluster-api work with only Ubuntu/Debian?**

Currently the cluster-template only supports Ubuntu because it uses `apt` and it
does a couple of assumptions around networking. This does not mean that you
can't use `cluster-api-provier-packet` with other templates, but you will have
to make your own cluster specification in order to make the installation process
to work as you want.
