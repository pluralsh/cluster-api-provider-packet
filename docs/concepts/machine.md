# PacketMachine CRD

PacketMachine is the name of the resource that identifies a
[Device](equinixMetalDeviceAPI) on Packet.

This is an example of it:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: PacketMachine
metadata:
  name: "qa-controlplane-0"
spec:
  OS: "ubuntu_18_04"
  billingCycle: hourly
  machineType: "t2.small"
  sshKeys:
  - "your-sshkey-name"
  tags: []
```

It is a [Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](openapi-types) as everything
else in the cluster-api land.

The reported fields in the example are the most common one but you can see the
full list of supported parameters as part of the OpenAPI definition available
[here](../../config/crd/bases/infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io_packetclusters.yaml)
searching for `kind: PacketMachine`.

The `PacketMachine`, `PacketCluster`, and `PacketMachineTemplate` CRD specs are also documented at [docs.crds.dev](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-packet).

## Reserved instances

Packet provides the possibility to [reserve
hardware](equinix-metal-docs-reserved-hardware) in order to have to power you need
always available.

> Reserved hardware gives you the ability to reserve specific servers for a
> committed period of time. Unlike hourly on-demand, once you reserve hardware,
> you will have access to that specific hardware for the duration of the
> reservation.

You can specify the reservation ID using the field `hardwareReservationID`:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: PacketMachine
metadata:
  name: "qa-controlplane-0"
spec:
  OS: "ubuntu_18_04"
  facility:
  - "dfw2"
  billingCycle: hourly
  machineType: "t2.small"
  sshKeys:
  - "your-sshkey-name"
  hardwareReservationID: "d3cb029a-c5e4-4e2b-bafc-56266639685f"
  tags: []
```

### pros and cons

Hardware reservation is a great feature, this chapter is about the feature
described above and nothing more.
It covers a very simple use case, you have a set of machines that you created
statically in the YAML and you like to have them using a reservation ID.

It does not work in combination of PacketMachineTemplate and MachineDeployment
where the pool of PacketMachine is dynamically managed by the cluster-api
controllers. You can track progress on this scenario subscribing to the issue
["Add support for reservation IDs with MachineDeployment #136"](github-issue-resid-dynamic) on GitHub.
